Adaptive Quiz Game: Utilizing Simple Machine Learning for Personalized Learning Experiences


Abstract:

This project aims to develop an adaptive quiz game application that utilizes basic machine learning techniques to personalize the learning experience for users. Unlike complex evolutionary algorithms and deep neural networks, this project will employ simpler machine learning algorithms to adapt the difficulty level of quiz questions based on users' performance. By providing tailored challenges, the application aims to enhance engagement and learning outcomes in a fun and interactive manner.

Introduction

The integration of technology into education has opened up opportunities for personalized learning experiences. Quiz games, known for their interactive and engaging nature, offer a promising platform for educational purposes. However, existing quiz games often lack adaptability, providing static sets of questions regardless of users' proficiency levels. This project seeks to address this limitation by developing an adaptive quiz game application that adjusts the difficulty of questions based on users' performance.

Aim and Objective

The primary aim of this project is to develop an adaptive quiz game application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to personalize the learning experience for users. The objectives include:

1. Designing and implementing a user-friendly quiz game application.
2. Integrating basic machine learning algorithms to analyze users' performance and adapt question difficulty.
3. Evaluating the effectiveness of the adaptive quiz game in enhancing user engagement and learning outcomes.

   
Methodology


The methodology involves the following steps:
1. Designing the user interface and gameplay mechanics of the quiz game application.
2. Developing a simple machine learning model to analyze users' performance metrics, such as correctness and response time.
3. Implementing algorithms to dynamically adjust the difficulty level of quiz questions based on users' performance.
4. Conducting user testing to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the adaptive quiz game.

In conclusion, this project proposes the development of an adaptive quiz game application that leverages basic machine learning techniques to personalize the learning experience for users. By dynamically adjusting question difficulty based on users' performance, the application aims to enhance engagement and facilitate better learning outcomes. Through iterative design, implementation, and evaluation, this project contributes to the exploration of personalized learning approaches in educational technology.
